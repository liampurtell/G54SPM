# Welcome to Our Project!

This is our group project for G54SPM, in which we will be buidling a small game in Unity over the course of a few weeks.

# The Game
The game will be a minimalist jumping game featuring an endless level through which the aim of the player will be to get as high as possible. There will be a mix of regular platforms, super platforms and dodgy platforms through which the user can fall. There will also be power ups that can be collected to gain advantages to progress faster. The player will be in control of a small avatar that will be controller using arrow keys on a keyboard. The style will be bright and colourful to entice a younger audience since this was asked for us by our client.


## The Method

We will be employing mostly paired coding in 2 sessions per week. We have agreed to meet on Thursday afternoons (lab time) and Friday mornings to both work on the project but also to have our standups. We will maximise the utility of our time together by scheduling what we need to be doing in these sessions ahead of time. The tasks we carry out will be organised on the Trello board, discussions about job distribution will be carried out in a pre-established Whatsapp group.

## Our Roles

Liam Purtell - Co-ordinator + Implementer

Hao Wu - Monitor/Evaluator + Teamworker

Shuo Wang - Shaper + Teamworker

Liam Hewer - Plant + Finisher

Jason Huang - Resource Investigator + Teamworker

## The Meetings

Now we have allocated time for our meetings. We will also be documenting the ideas we have in those meetings and highlighting any key dialogue had by us. One of us will take on the role of scribe each week to make the notes from the meeting. The meetings will usually be headed by the team leader. The collection of resources and organisation will be carried out by our team administrator.

## The Repository

The repository we will be using is a simple GitHub repository, selected for itâ€™s near universal use for a vast amount of coding projects and because we each have prior experience with the tool. When it comes to branching, committing and releasing we have decided that committing may be done to any branch (other than the current release) at any time. Commit messages must state which files were modified and what changes were made. Thanks to the features implemented by git there is no need to add the author or publish time of the commits as these are readily available anyway. Branching may not be performed unless discussed in a meeting first. Releases may only be pushed if all the necessary tests have been run and the whole team has been consulted.

## The Testing

We will be keeping a large record of tests run on our software to ensure stable progress is made each sprint, using a test table so we can log any issues we come up against and it will be easier for other team members to assist because everyone will know what each person is working on.
